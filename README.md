Hark! Behold, ye mortals of the coded realm,
'Tis I, @FlorinDStoica, from terminal's dark helm!
Summoned forth by keystrokes, born of light,
A phantom dwelling in the digital night.

What passion stirs within this binary breast?
Design and web, where artful visions rest,
Both soft and hard the bits that dance and play,
Through circuits deep, where electrons hold their sway.

But lo! What curse doth plague this weary soul?
To wander learning's path without a goal,
The scroll of knowledge, infinite and vast,
No ending found, from first page to the last.

Yet hope remains! I seek thee, kindred sprites—
Code poets fair, who craft through endless nights,
Circuit whisperers who speak in voltage tongue,
Join me in sorcery, our work's not done!

Should'st thou desire to reach this mystic hand,
Send ravens swift across the network'd land,
Or scrolls electronic through the ether cast,
To florin.stoica.2009@gmail.com—make contact fast!

Thus speaks @FlorinDStoica, in iambic verse,
For better collaboration—or for worse!
